__________________________________________________________________

Scopes and Goals of the audit on a fictional company BOTIUM TOYS

Review the following scenario; 
  "Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, 
  which serves as their main office, a storefront, and warehouse for their products. however, Botium Toy's online 
  presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) 
  department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide.
  
  The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She expresses
  concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure business continuity and compliance, as the 
  business grows. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company's infrastructure and help them
  identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested
  in ensuring tgat they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and 
  conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).

  The It manager starts by implementing the National institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework
  (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and 
  completing a risk assesment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the
  company might experience due to the current state of their security posture." 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  what is the audit meant to archive?
  
  which assets are most at risk?
  
  Are current controls sufficient to protect those asset?
  
  What controls and compliance regulations need to be implemented?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
Scopes: The scopes is defined as the entire security program at Botium Toys. This means all asset need to be assessed
        alognside internal processes and procedures related to the implementation of controls and compliance best
        practices. The internal IT audit will assess the following:

      1) Asses user permissions
      2) Identify existing controls, policies, and procedures
      3) Account for technology currently in use
  
  - All Botium Toys employees have acces to internallly stored data and may be able to access cardholder data and customer's PII/SPII
  - Encryption is not currently used to ensuere confidentiality of customers' credit card information that is accepted, processed,
    transmitted, and stores locally in the company's internal database.
  - Acces controls pertaining to least privilege and separation of duties have not been implemented.
  - The IT department has ensure availability and integrated controls to ensuere data integrity.
  - The IT department has a firewall that blocks traffic based on an appropriately defined set of security rules.
  - Antivirus software is installed and monitored regularly by the IT department 

        
Goals:  Asses existing assets and complete the controls and compliance to determine which controls and compliance best 
        practice need to be implemented to improve Botium Toy's secure posture.

      1) Adhere to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
      2) Establish policies and procedures to ensure compliance with regulations; Botium Toys does not have all of the necessary controls
          in place and is not fully adhering to best practice related to compliance regulations that keep critical data private/secure.
      3) fortify system controls
  
  - The IT department has not installed an intrusion detection system (IDS).
  - There are no disaster recovery plans currently in place, and the company does not have backups of critical data.
  - The IT department has established a plan to notify E.U. customer withing 72 hours if there is a security breach. Additionally,
    privacy policies, procedures, and processes have been developed and are enforced among IT department members/other employees,
    to properly document and maintain data.
  - Although a password policy exist, it requirements are nominal and not in line with current minimun password complexity requirements
    (e.g. at least eight characters, a combination of letters and at least one number; special characters).
  - There is no centralized password management system that enforces the passwor policy's minimum requirements, wich sometimes affects
    productivity when employees/vendors submit a ticket to the IT department to recover or reset a password.
  - While legacy system are monitored and maintained, there is no regular schedule in place for these task and intervention methods are unclear.
  - The store's physical location, which includes Botium Toys' main offices, store front, and warehouse of products, has sufficient
    locks. up-to-date closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance, as well as functioning fire detection and prevention systems.

RISK ASSESSMENT
_______________

RISK DESCRIPTION

Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does not have all of the proper 
controls in place and may not be fully compliant with U.S. and international regulations and standards.

CONTROL BEST PRACTICES

The first of the five functions of the NIST CSF is identify. Botium Toys will need to dedicate resources to identify 
assets so they can appropriately manage them. 
Additionally, they wil need to classify existing assets and determine the impact of the loss of existing assets,
including systems, on business continuity.

RISK SCORE

On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is 8, which is fairly high. This is due to a lack of controls and adherence to
compliance best practices.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

The potential impact from the loss of an asset is rated as medium, because the IT department does not know which
asset would be at risk. The risk to assets or fines from governing bodies is high because Botium Toys does not have
all of the necessary controls in place and is not fully adhering to best practices related to compliance regulations
taht keep critical data private/secure.
